The process to tune this parameters was not standarized. The default value for the learning rate of 0.001 seems to overshoot the local minima, so I changed it to 0.0008 and it showed a smooth step now.The number of epochs was augmented to 55 because with epochs = 40 the behavior was not asymptotic yet. The batch size was set to 128, because with batch_size=64 the oscilations in the acuraccy values beetween epochs were higher and with 128, the value of the validation acuraccy tended to increase faster.\n",

ANSWER: the convolutional layer might work well because it's highly recomended for images, because its layers start recognizing the low level features of an image and then combines them to locate the high level feautures. Another good decision was to remove shear transformation in the data augmentation step, the validation acuraccy was better after the change. How might a dropout layer help with creating a successful model? The dropout layers decreased the overfitting a lot, forcing the network not to trust a single neuron.\n"
